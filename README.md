# command_line_tictactoe
Basic tic-tac-toe game I built from scratch with only minimal Stack Exchange questions for practice as part of Jose Portilla's "Complete Python Bootcamp" on Udemy. 

Written in Python 2.7 using Atom.

Features: 
Basic command line tic tac toe that prints out the game board after every turn. 
Moves are recorded using a global dictionary and a global list. 
Users can play again saving usernames and wiping the board. 
Checks for previously used positions and whether entered positions exist. 
Allows the game to end in a tie.

Rules: 
Enter player names to begin. 
Enter choices as coordinates in a a-c, 1-3 9x9 grid system. 
If you want to quit, type 'quit' at anytime.
